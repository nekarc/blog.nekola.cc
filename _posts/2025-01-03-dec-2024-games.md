This December, I dove into a variety of games, thanks in large part to the incredible winter sale on Steam. The sale not only gave me the opportunity to explore a range of new titles but also helped me discover a few gems that I'll be carrying over into the next year. From voxel-based adventures to cozy bookshops and everything in between, here's a rundown of the games I played and my thoughts on each:

### Enshrouded 
- üè† A voxel-based survival and base-building game set in a beautifully handcrafted world. I thoroughly enjoyed the voxel-based base-building mechanics. The handcrafted and detailed environment of the world drew me in, making exploration incredibly satisfying.  
*Review:* A fantastic choice for fans of sandbox and base-building games, with a beautifully designed world to immerse yourself in.

### Potion Craft
- üß™ A unique alchemy simulator where players create potions by experimenting with ingredients and navigating a potion map. The concept was intriguing, and I appreciated the alchemy-themed gameplay. However, I felt that the process of forming new potions could benefit from more guidance or direction.  
*Review:* A unique and creative alchemy simulator, though it could use a bit more structure for better accessibility.

### Tiny Bookshop Demo
- üìö A cozy simulation game where you manage a bookshop and recommend books to customers based on their preferences. This was a cozy and relaxed experience. I particularly enjoyed recommending books to customers based on their characteristics and dialogues ‚Äî a charming and personal touch.  
*Review:* A delightful demo that promises a warm, bookish adventure perfect for unwinding.

### Strange Horticulture Demo
- üåø A mystery puzzle game where you run a plant shop and solve puzzles by identifying plants and uncovering secrets. An interesting game, though the demo felt too short for me to form a solid opinion. I hope the full game builds into a compelling story.  
*Review:* A promising mystery game with a lot of potential for engaging storytelling and atmosphere.

### Spellcaster University
- üè´ A management game where you build and run a magical university, utilizing cards to shape the curriculum and train students. As someone not deeply into card-based games, I found this one engaging without being overwhelming. It struck a good balance for me.  
*Review:* A fun and balanced mix of card mechanics and university management, ideal for casual players.

### Mind Over Magic
- üßô A simulation game where you manage a magical dungeon and its inhabitants. The tutorial felt overly detailed and wiki-like, which made it less enjoyable. I would have preferred concise pointers to get started, and unfortunately, this led me to drop the game early.  
*Review:* Has potential for those who enjoy in-depth tutorials, but its start might deter players seeking a quicker entry.

### Minami Lane
- üå∏ A minimalist puzzle game focused on building and decorating a vibrant lane. My first 100% completed game! The aesthetics and colors were breathtaking, a true visual treat. It was short and minimal yet captivating. The final level (Mission 5), where everything comes together, was the highlight for me.  
*Review:* A stunning and minimalist experience, perfect for players who appreciate art and short-form storytelling.

### A Little to the Left
- üß© A puzzle game where you organize objects in visually satisfying ways. A nice game overall, but it started to feel repetitive after a while, which diminished my engagement.  
*Review:* A soothing puzzle game that's great in small doses but may lack variety for long sessions.

### Gris
- üé® A visually stunning platformer with a focus on emotion and exploration, accompanied by a breathtaking soundtrack. The visuals were stunning, and the soundtrack was fabulous. However, as someone who isn't great at platforming games, I found the gameplay sometimes broke the immersive feel for me.  
*Review:* A breathtaking visual and auditory journey, though it may challenge players less comfortable with platforming mechanics.

### Overcooked 2
- üç≥ A co-op cooking game where players work together to prepare and serve meals under time pressure. An absolute blast to play with friends! It's chaotic, fun, and perfect for group gaming sessions.  
*Review:* A hilarious and fast-paced multiplayer game that thrives on teamwork and chaos.

### Fields of Mistria
- üåæ A farming simulation game reminiscent of Stardew Valley, with a focus on aesthetics and character interactions. This game reminded me of Stardew Valley but with aesthetics I found even more appealing. I'm excited to keep playing it into 2025.  
*Review:* A charming farming sim with beautiful visuals and plenty of heart, a must-try for fans of the genre.

### Alba: A Wildlife Adventure
- ü¶ú An adventure game about a young girl's efforts to save wildlife and protect nature. A wonderful game to 100% with relatively little effort. The nature conservation theme was refreshing and well-executed.  
*Review:* A heartfelt and accessible game that highlights environmental awareness in a delightful way.

### Tavern Talk
- üç∑ A narrative-driven game set in a cozy tavern, featuring charming characters and meaningful conversations. Cozy and soothing with wonderful characters. It was comforting and left me feeling warm and fuzzy.  
*Review:* A relaxing narrative-driven game with charming interactions, perfect for winding down.

### Until Then Demo
- üï∞Ô∏è A narrative-focused game exploring themes of loss and moving forward. I gave this one a try, and while it was nice, it's not something I'm drawn to at this point.  
*Review:* A well-made demo that might resonate more with fans of slower-paced narrative games.

### Fae Farm Demo
- üßö A farm simulation game with a whimsical fantasy setting and detailed character creation. The character creation was delightful, but the gameplay felt too similar to other games in the genre, making it less engaging for me.  
*Review:* A visually appealing farm sim demo that lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from similar titles.

### Birds Organized Neatly
- üê¶ A puzzle game where you arrange quirky bird pieces into grids, complete with humorous descriptions. I'm planning to 100% this one, though it does feel repetitive after a while. The hilarious bird descriptions kept it fun and light-hearted.  
*Review:* A quirky and fun puzzle game that's easy to pick up and enjoy in short bursts.

### Fruitbus
- üçâ A first-person simulation game about running a mobile fruit-selling business. An interesting concept, but the first-person gameplay made me nauseous, so I couldn't enjoy it fully.  
*Review:* A creative idea with charming elements, though its first-person perspective might not suit everyone.

December offered a spectrum of experiences, from cozy and soothing to visually stunning and creatively engaging. Each game added its own flavor to my gaming month, and I'm looking forward to seeing where my gaming journey takes me next!
