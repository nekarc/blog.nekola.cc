Nobunaga Concerto, the 2014 live-action series and its follow-up movie, answers this question with humor, heart, and surprising depth. Based on Ayumi Ishii’s manga, the story chronicles Saburo’s accidental journey to the Sengoku era, where he must assume the role of Oda Nobunaga and navigate the challenges of leadership, war, and relationships.At its core, Nobunaga Concerto is a story of transformation — not just of history, but of Saburo himself. This blog explores how the series portrays his growth from a reluctant impostor to a leader capable of inspiring those around him, all while forging profound connections with the characters around him. Among the many relationships Saburo forms, his evolving bonds with Kicho and Tsuneoki stand out the most to me.Saburo’s GrowthSaburo’s journey begins with his characteristic modern-day carelessness. Thrust into the role of Nobunaga, he is initially overwhelmed by the weight of his responsibilities and the brutal reality of the Sengoku era. His reliance on instinct and a desire to protect those he cares about often leads to unorthodox solutions that both confound and endear him to those around him. As he reluctantly steps into Nobunaga’s role, his lack of strategy and historical knowledge often leads to humorous, if not disastrous, results. Yet, beneath his clumsiness lies a surprising strength: his compassion and ability to see people as individuals rather than pawns in a political game.Over time, the weight of his responsibilities pushes Saburo to mature. He learns to think beyond himself, understanding the larger implications of his actions. Importantly, his transformation isn’t a sudden, heroic leap but a gradual process filled with setbacks, self-doubt, and moments of quiet realization. By the end of the series and movie, Saburo emerges not as the historical Nobunaga we know but as a leader defined by his unique blend of modern values and a growing sense of duty.KichoSaburo’s relationship with Kicho, Nobunaga’s wife, reflects the series’ emotional core. Initially, Kicho views him with suspicion and frustration. To her, Saburo’s odd behavior and unconventional methods are a poor match for the role of a feudal lord. However, as she witnesses his earnest attempts to protect his people and those close to him, her perspective shifts.Kicho’s gradual trust and eventual partnership with Saburo highlight her own development as well. From a figure bound by the constraints of her era, she becomes a steadfast ally, choosing to support Saburo not because of his title but because of the person he grows to be. By the movie’s conclusion, their relationship stands as a testament to mutual respect and shared purpose, transcending the roles they were forced into.TsuneokiTsuneoki’s journey with Saburo begins in a place of cautious loyalty. As Nobunaga’s trusted retainer, he is committed to supporting his lord but is often bewildered by Saburo’s eccentricities. Early interactions between the two are marked by tension as Tsuneoki struggles to reconcile Saburo’s seemingly frivolous approach with the high stakes of their world.What makes Tsuneoki’s relationship with Saburo so compelling is the subtle shift from obligation to genuine camaraderie. Over time, Tsuneoki comes to see Saburo not as an impostor but as a leader who, despite his unconventional ways, genuinely cares for those around him. Their growing bond is one of the most rewarding arcs in the series, showcasing how respect and friendship can overcome even the most profound differences.My Final ThoughtsNobunaga Concerto is far more than a historical drama or a time-travel tale — it’s a story of growth, resilience, and the power of relationships. Saburo’s transformation from a carefree teenager to a reluctant yet capable leader is a journey filled with humor, heartache, and triumph. Among the many relationships he forms, his bonds with Kicho and Tsuneoki are especially compelling to me because they highlight his humanity and the depth of his growth as a leader. Their evolution from skepticism to mutual trust and respect adds an emotional richness that stays with you long after the story ends.Watching Nobunaga Concerto reminded me of the importance of relationships in shaping who we are. The humor and heartfelt moments made this series and movie an unforgettable experience — one I’d gladly revisit." }, { "title": "My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday", "url": "/posts/my-tomorrow-your-yesterday/", "categories": "Reviews, Movies", "tags": "jdrama, movies, reviews", "date": "2024-12-03 06:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "In a world where we often cling to permanence — whether in relationships, achievements, or material possessions — My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday reminds us that impermanence is not something to fear b...", "content": "In a world where we often cling to permanence — whether in relationships, achievements, or material possessions — My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday reminds us that impermanence is not something to fear but something to embrace. Directed by Takahiro Miki, this Japanese film explores the fleeting nature of life and the beauty found within it. Through its unconventional narrative, the movie asks us to confront our own relationships with time and the way we perceive permanence.Through a love story that unfolds across timelines, the movie beautifully explores how time moves forward, backward, and sometimes in ways we don’t understand, urging us to reflect on the preciousness of every passing moment.The Tragic Beauty of LoveAt its core, My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday is a tragic love story. It follows the relationship between Takatoshi, a university student, and Emi, a girl who experiences time in reverse. While Takatoshi moves through his life in a linear fashion, Emi’s memories move backward, living her future as her past. This bizarre time anomaly creates a poignant juxtaposition: while Takatoshi can look forward to the future, Emi can only look back at a past that has already happened.The film confronts the painful reality that not all love stories have happy endings and that some connections are destined to be brief, no matter how strong they are. For Takatoshi, grappling with this reality feels like a crushing weight, as he realizes their love will never grow in the conventional sense. For Emi, the burden is just as heavy — she carries the knowledge that their time together is slipping away with every moment they share.But within this sadness, there is a beauty that speaks to the heart. It’s a reminder that love, even if it is fleeting, can be transformative and meaningful. The film doesn’t shy away from the harshness of life. It shows us that sometimes, no matter how deeply we care for someone, we cannot change the circumstances. And yet, the moments we share with others — no matter how short-lived — leave a lasting impact on who we are.The story invites us to reflect on the fleeting nature of time in our own lives. How often do we take moments for granted, assuming we will have tomorrow, only to realize that the present is all we truly have? Takatoshi’s journey with Emi teaches him, and us, the importance of living in the moment, making the most of the time we have, and finding meaning in the impermanence of life.Accepting the Passage of TimeThroughout the film, Takatoshi struggles with his feelings of helplessness as he faces the transient nature of his relationship with Emi. The pain of knowing that their love will never be “normal” — that they cannot grow old together or share the future they dream of — reflects the existential anxiety we all feel when we confront the passage of time. Yet, My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday also teaches us that the beauty of love and life doesn’t lie in their permanence but in their fleeting nature.Takatoshi, initially consumed by the impossibility of their future, slowly learns to treasure the present, transforming his despair into gratitude. Emi, though bound by her reversed timeline, finds solace in the shared moments that redefine her existence, however brief they may be. Together, they show us that love doesn’t need to last forever to be meaningful. It is the depth of the connection in the present that gives it its value.The film doesn’t offer easy answers or happy endings. Instead, it encourages the viewer to accept the impermanence of all things and find meaning in the fleeting moments we have. In Emi’s reversed timeline, there is no “forever” in the traditional sense. But perhaps the film suggests that in embracing impermanence, we can find freedom — freedom to love fully, to live fully, and to accept the natural ebb and flow of life.My Final ThoughtsThe movie’s central theme resonates with the universal human experience: we are all touched by the passing of time, by the inevitable loss of people and moments. But rather than mourning this, we should learn to celebrate the beauty in the transience of life. Each moment is a fleeting gift, and it’s only by embracing that impermanence that we can find true meaning in our lives.In a way, the movie reflects all our lives: transient, fragile, and yet immeasurably beautiful. It teaches us that what makes moments special is not their permanence but the love and meaning we infuse into them. By embracing this transient nature of life, we learn to love more deeply, live more fully, and cherish the present. And perhaps, in doing so, we can come to peace with the inevitable passage of time, knowing that it is not what we keep, but what we let go, that shapes who we are." }, { "title": "You Made My Dawn", "url": "/posts/you-made-my-dawn/", "categories": "Reviews, Movies", "tags": "jdrama, movies, reviews", "date": "2024-12-03 05:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "What does it mean to truly express ourselves? “You Made My Dawn”, or “Yoru ga Aketara Ichiban ni Kimi ni Ai ni Iku”, is a tender exploration of the strength it takes to shed emotional restraints an...", "content": "What does it mean to truly express ourselves? “You Made My Dawn”, or “Yoru ga Aketara Ichiban ni Kimi ni Ai ni Iku”, is a tender exploration of the strength it takes to shed emotional restraints and live authentically. At its heart, the movie conveys a profound idea: seeing the world as our own empowers us to express ourselves freely and connect with life on a deeper, more genuine level.The Story’s EssenceThe film follows Akane, someone who has spent much of their life smiling through struggles, suppressing their emotions to meet external expectations. Through moments of self-realization, Seiji helps Akane come to understand that the way they see the world is uniquely theirs, and embracing this personal perspective allows them to express their emotions without fear or hesitation.This is beautifully captured in the line: This world is mine. The world as one sees it, belongs to them completely. Because the world that you see is different from what anyone else sees.Key ThemesThe Connection Between Perspective and EmotionSeeing the world as our own gives us the confidence to express our emotions freely. When we fully embrace our unique perspective, we no longer feel the need to suppress or distort our feelings for the sake of conformity. The film reminds us that accepting our individuality is the first step to genuine self-expression.The Importance of Emotional HonestyExpressing emotions — whether joy, anger, or sadness — is not a sign of weakness but a profound act of courage. Suppressing feelings for the sake of politeness often creates a disconnect, both with ourselves and others. The movie asserts: That was great. Say it. Let everything out.This call to action emphasizes the liberation and authenticity that come with emotional honesty.Removing the MaskMany of us hide behind a mask of constant smiles and agreeableness, even when our true feelings tell a different story. The film encourages us to let go of this facade, reminding us that it’s okay to show vulnerability. Protecting our inner world means acknowledging and honoring our emotions: You should protect your own heart at the very least.Time is PreciousBy confronting life’s fleeting nature, the movie inspires us to act and express ourselves without delay. Its poignant reminder is encapsulated in the line: It’s best to say what you want, and do what you want. Because time is not eternal.Seeing the World as Your OwnWhen we view the world as ours — a space where our unique perspective matters — it becomes easier to express genuine emotions. This mindset creates a sense of ownership and belonging, reducing the fear of judgment. By seeing the world through this lens, we can connect with life more authentically and courageously.My Final ThoughtsYou Made My Dawn feels like a gentle reminder to stop hiding and start embracing life. It reassures us that our emotions and perspectives are valid, and that expressing them strengthens our connection to ourselves and the world around us. This film is a quiet celebration of what it means to be human: to feel, to express, and to connect. It asks us to consider: Are we seeing the world as our own? Are we giving ourselves the space to express our true emotions?" }, { "title": "Katakana", "url": "/posts/kana-2/", "categories": "References, Japanese", "tags": "japanese, study, docs", "date": "2024-11-28 06:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "", "content": "" }, { "title": "Hiragana", "url": "/posts/kana-1/", "categories": "References, Japanese", "tags": "japanese, study, docs", "date": "2024-11-28 05:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "", "content": "" }, { "title": "If Cats Disappeared from the World", "url": "/posts/if-cats-disappeared/", "categories": "Reviews, Movies", "tags": "jdrama, movies, reviews", "date": "2024-11-26 08:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "There are some stories that resonate so deeply they become a part of you, and for me, If Cats Disappeared from the World is one of them.

This Japanese film has captured my heart not just for its poignant narrative, but for the way it gently reminds us of life’s impermanence and the quiet joys we often overlook.It’s not merely a movie I admire — it’s my most favorite movie of all time. So much so that I’ve set a personal goal: to one day read its original Japanese version. I’m actively learning the language, partly inspired by this desire, hoping to experience the story in the words its author, Genki Kawamura, originally penned. I believe doing so will deepen my connection to the film, allowing me to uncover layers of meaning and nuance that might be lost in translation.This isn’t just a story about cats; it’s a story about what it means to live, love, and let go.A Deal with the DevilThe premise is deceptively simple yet profound. The story follows a young postman who discovers he has a terminal illness. Just as he begins to grapple with his mortality, the Devil appears with a sinister bargain: he can extend his life by one day for every item he agrees to erase from the world.What begins with seemingly trivial objects like phones and clocks gradually escalates to even removing cats from existence. Each choice forces the protagonist to confront the value of what he’s giving up and what these things mean to the people around him.Cats in the film are more than just adorable companions. They symbolize the unspoken ties between people, representing comfort, love, and nostalgia. The protagonist’s cat, Cabbage, acts as a bridge to his late mother, a connection to his past, and a silent witness to his lonely life.When the prospect of erasing cats arises, the protagonist is forced to confront what truly matters. The film delicately explores how the things we take for granted — whether an animal, a memory, or a shared moment — anchor us to our humanity.Themes That LingerIf Cats Disappeared from the World lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, its themes weaving a tapestry of introspection:The Fragility of Life: The film doesn’t shy away from the inevitability of death. Instead, it asks us to reflect on how we spend our time and who we choose to share it with.The Cost of Convenience: By erasing objects like phones and clocks, the protagonist experiences both freedom and isolation. The story subtly critiques our dependence on modern conveniences, urging us to reevaluate what we truly need.The Weight of Loss: With every disappearance, a void is left behind. The film explores how absence shapes our understanding of presence, teaching us that love and loss are two sides of the same coin. When you lose something, you realize just how much you needed it. And sometimes, you never get the chance to say goodbye.A Cinematic MasterpieceVisually, the film is breathtaking. Director Akira Nagai crafts a visually stunning film, using muted tones and intimate framing to convey the protagonist’s introspection and create an atmosphere of quiet reflection. The cat, Cabbage, is a scene-stealer, its quiet presence underscoring moments of tenderness and sorrow. The performances, particularly by Takeru Satoh as the protagonist and the Devil, bring depth and charm to this introspective tale.My Personal TakeThis movie isn’t just a story — it’s a reminder to cherish the fleeting moments of life. It doesn’t offer easy answers, and that’s precisely what makes it so impactful. It asks us to sit with uncomfortable truths, contemplate the impermanence of everything we hold dear, and find meaning in our everyday lives.For me, If Cats Disappeared from the World is more than a favorite movie — it’s a guiding light. It’s inspired me not only to reflect on my own life but also to embark on a journey of learning Japanese so I can experience the story in its purest form.Final ThoughtsThis is a film for anyone who has ever loved, lost, or wondered what makes life truly meaningful. Its themes of connection, sacrifice, and acceptance resonate universally, making it a bittersweet yet profoundly beautiful experience.If you’ve ever found yourself wondering what you’d give up — or what you’d fight to keep — this movie will speak to you.PS.

However, not...", "content": "Vitamins are essential nutrients that our bodies need to function optimally. These organic compounds support various physiological processes, from energy production to immune function. However, not all vitamins are the same. They are broadly classified into fat-soluble and water-soluble categories based on how they are absorbed, transported, stored, and excreted in the body.Toxicity Risk: Fat-Soluble vs. Water-Soluble VitaminsOne of the most critical differences between fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is their toxicity risk, which arises from how they are stored and excreted. Understanding the toxicity risks of vitamins is vital because many people turn to supplements for health benefits. While supplements can help fill gaps in nutrition, over-reliance or indiscriminate use can harm your body.Fat-Soluble Vitamins: Higher Toxicity RiskFat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are stored in the liver and fatty tissues. This storage mechanism allows them to build up over time, which is helpful during periods of low dietary intake. However, excessive consumption — usually through supplements or fortified foods — can lead to toxicity (hypervitaminosis). Unlike water-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble ones are not readily excreted by the body, so any excess remains stored. Since they accumulate in the body, it’s easy to exceed the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) if you’re taking supplements or consuming fortified foods alongside a vitamin-rich diet. Vitamin A Toxicity (Hypervitaminosis A): Occurs with prolonged high intake of vitamin A (often from supplements or animal liver). Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, headaches, bone pain, and in severe cases, liver damage or birth defects during pregnancy. Chronic toxicity can lead to osteoporosis and fractures. Vitamin D Toxicity (Hypervitaminosis D): Results from over-supplementation, not sun exposure. Causes hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels), leading to nausea, weakness, kidney stones, or even heart problems. Vitamin E Toxicity: While rare, excessive vitamin E can cause blood thinning, increasing the risk of hemorrhage. Vitamin K Toxicity: Rare because vitamin K is tightly regulated in the body, but high doses of synthetic vitamin K (not dietary forms) may affect blood clotting. Water-Soluble Vitamins: Minimal Toxicity RiskWater-soluble vitamins (B-complex and C) dissolve in water and are not stored in the body for long periods. Excess amounts are generally excreted through urine, which lowers the risk of toxicity. However, consuming mega doses of certain water-soluble vitamins can still lead to side effects. The body’s ability to excrete excess water-soluble vitamins provides a safety net, but very high doses can still lead to adverse effects. Vitamin C: Excessive intake (above 2,000 mg/day) may cause gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps. Long-term high doses might lead to kidney stone formation in susceptible individuals. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): Chronic high doses (above 100 mg/day) can lead to nerve damage, causing numbness, tingling, or even difficulty walking. Niacin (Vitamin B3): Excessive intake, especially from supplements, can cause skin flushing, itching, and liver damage in severe cases. Final ThoughtsFat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are stored in the body, making overconsumption more likely to cause toxicity. Water-soluble vitamins (B-complex and C) are generally safer due to their excretion in urine, but extremely high doses can still lead to side effects. Strive for a balanced diet and use supplements responsibly to support health without unnecessary risks.PS. Note on MineralsMinerals are vital for various bodily functions, but excessive intake can lead to toxicity, particularly when they are consumed through supplements rather than natural dietary sources. Here’s a breakdown of minerals based on their risk of toxicity: Minerals like iron, selenium, zinc, and iodine pose the highest risk of toxicity when consumed in excessive amounts, especially through supplements. Moderate-risk minerals like calcium and magnesium can cause problems with overuse of supplements or fortified foods. Low-risk minerals, such as potassium and sodium, are usually problematic only when consumed in extreme amounts or in individuals with underlying health conditions." }, { "title": "Elemental Reactions in Genshin", "url": "/posts/genshin-reactions/", "categories": "References, Genshin", "tags": "games, genshin, docs", "date": "2024-11-26 06:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "Genshin Impact’s combat system is built on an intricate interplay of elemental reactions that bring battles to life.

These reactions are triggered when two or more elements interact, either applied by characters’ abilities or environmental effects. Certain reactions, such as Melt and Vaporize, feature asymmetric damage multipliers depending on which element triggers the reaction. This adds a layer of depth to Genshin Impact’s combat system.Genshin Impact features seven elements: Pyro (Fire) Hydro (Water) Cryo (Ice) Electro (Electric) Anemo (Wind) Geo (Earth) Dendro (Nature)Each element interacts differently depending on the combination, leading to unique effects. Some are damage-focused, while others control enemy movement or provide utility.Damage-Oriented Reactions Overloaded Elements: Pyro + Electro Effect: Deals AoE Pyro damage. Best Against: Groups of enemies, especially those with physical shields. Tips: Use Overloaded to break shields or stagger enemies, but be cautious of its knockback, which can scatter foes. Vaporize Elements: Pyro + Hydro Effect: Multiplies damage (1.5x or 2x depending on the order of elements). Best Against: Single-target foes or bosses. Tips: Use Hydro first followed by Pyro for the higher damage multiplier (2x). Melt Elements: Pyro + Cryo Effect: Multiplies damage (1.5x or 2x depending on the order of elements). Best Against: High-HP enemies. Tips: Apply Cryo first and follow up with Pyro for optimal damage. Superconduct Elements: Cryo + Electro Effect: Reduces enemy physical resistance and deals AoE Cryo damage. Best Against: Physically built teams or shielded enemies. Tips: Pair with physical DPS characters like Eula or Razor to take full advantage of the resistance shred. Utility Reactions Swirl Elements: Anemo + Any (Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, Electro) Effect: Spreads the secondary element and deals AoE damage. Best Against: Groups of enemies with elemental statuses. Tips: Use characters like Kazuha or Sucrose to group enemies while spreading the desired element for efficient damage output. Crystallize Elements: Geo + Any (Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, Electro) Effect: Generates an elemental shield based on the absorbed element. Best Against: Situations requiring defense or protection. Tips: Pair with Geo characters like Zhongli for stronger shields or Noelle for hybrid utility. Dendro Reactions Burning Elements: Dendro + Pyro Effect: Deals continuous Pyro damage in an area. Tips: Effective against stationary enemies but risky in tight spaces due to lingering fire effects. Bloom Elements: Dendro + Hydro Effect: Creates Dendro Cores that explode after a short duration, dealing AoE Dendro damage. Tips: Pair with an Electro character for Hyperbloom or Pyro for Burgeon to amplify the reaction. Burgeon Elements: Pyro + Dendro Core (Dendro + Hydro) Effect: Triggers AoE Pyro damage at the Dendro Core’s location. Tips: Use fast AoE Pyro characters like Thoma or Bennett to trigger Burgeon quickly. Hyperbloom Elements: Electro + Dendro Core (Dendro + Hydro) Effect: Triggers AoE Electro damage at the Dendro Core’s location. Tips: Characters like Fischl, Beidou, Raiden Shogun, or Lisa are great for consistent Electro application. Quicken (and its variations) Elements: Dendro + Electro Effect: Creates a buffed state where additional Electro or Dendro triggers Aggravate (Electro bonus damage) or Spread (Dendro bonus damage). Tips: Build high Elemental Mastery on the reaction-triggering character for maximum damage. Elemental Reactions Where Order Matters Melt Cryo applied first, then Pyro: 2x Damage Pyro applied first, then Cryo: 1.5x Damage Example: If you use Ganyu’s Frostflake Arrow (Cryo) first and then follow with Hu Tao’s Charged Attack (Pyro), you’ll get a 2x damage multiplier, making it the optimal sequence for maximum damage. Vaporize Hydro applied first, then Pyro: 2x Damage Pyro applied first, then Hydro: 1.5x Damage Example: Pairing Xingqiu’s Rain Swords (Hydro) with Hu Tao’s Charged Attack (Pyro) ensures the Hydro is applied first, allowing Hu Tao to trigger a 2x multiplier on Vaporize. Overloaded, Superconduct, Swirl, and Others These reactions don’t have asymmetric multipliers — they deal a flat amount of damage regardless of the order. However, timing and positioning still matter, as these reactions often cause knockback or AoE effects that can disrupt enemy positioning. Dendro Reactions: Bloom, Hyperbloom, and Burgeon While Dendro-related reactions like Bloom are generally independent of application order, the triggering element (Pyro for Burgeon or Electro for Hyperbloom) decides the secondary reaction’s effect. Example: Apply Dendro with Nahida, then Hydro with Kokomi to create Bloom (Dendro Cores). Then use an Electro character like Fischl to trigger Hyperbloom, or a Pyro character like Thoma for Burgeon. Order in Quicken Variants (Spread/Aggravate) For Quicken, the element that triggers the follow-up reaction (Electro for Aggravate or Dendro for Spread) determines the bonus damage type. Building Elemental Mastery on the triggering character boosts the damage. The image below is concise overview of all the reactions explained earlier in a simple and easy to understand tabular format (obtained from the genshin wiki)." }, { "title": "Luma Island - First thoughts!", "url": "/posts/luma-island/", "categories": "Reviews, Games", "tags": "initial-thoughts, luma-island, reviews, games", "date": "2024-11-26 05:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "Stepping into the world of Luma Island feels like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket while still being encouraged to stay on your toes.

This life-simulation game has quickly become one of my go-to escapes, offering a balance of calming gameplay and just enough engagement to keep things interesting. After playing for around 20 in-game days (and restarting a couple of times), here are my initial impressions.A Cozy Yet Engaging ExperienceWhat immediately stands out about Luma Island is its cozy atmosphere. The visuals are vibrant and inviting, the soundtrack is soothing, and the gameplay flows in a way that feels relaxing without ever becoming dull. Whether I’m exploring the island, gathering resources, or completing quests, there’s always something to do — but never at a pace that feels overwhelming.First ImpressionsThe game’s story unfolds gradually, weaving themes of discovery, connection, and perhaps a touch of mystery. It’s not heavy-handed but instead invites you to piece things together through interactions with characters and the environment.The gameplay strikes a delightful balance between relaxing exploration and light challenges. From gathering resources to completing small puzzles, everything feels intuitive and rewarding. The island itself is full of surprises, inviting curiosity and encouraging experimentation.When I first started playing, I made the mistake of rushing through the initial profession selection. Without giving it much thought, I chose something that didn’t align with my playstyle or goals.
